<h2>Installing Nimbits Server on Google's infrastructure</h2>
<p>Nimbits Server can be downloaded and installed on your own <a href="https://appengine.google.com" target="_blank">Google
    App Engine</a> account simply by downloading the
    latest release and using the app engine SDK to upload it to your account. You can also deploy Nimbits on your own
    servers or Amazon EC2 </p>

<p>All of the Rest Api Services and portal functionality that you see on cloud.nimbits.com will be available on
    yourappid.appspot.com. Further, you can use Google Apps for Domains to put Nimbits on your domain i.e
    nimbits.yourdomain.com.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Good housekeeping for your Nimbits Server is to run <strong>./appcfg.sh vacuum_indexes
    /war</strong> which will delete unused legacy indexes that may have been deprecated with this upgrade. This can free
    up a lot of disk space if an old index is no longer needed.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="label success">Important</span>
    If you've been using Nimbits for a while and have a large amount of data in your data store, please check your
    "Data store Indexes" section of the admin console after performing an upgrade. You need to wait for all of the
    indexes
    to show as "Serving." If an upgrade includes a new index, it may take several hours to build before you can use the
    new
    version. You can continue using the previously installed version while you wait.
</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>If you are already familiar with using Google App Engine, and already have an instance setup. The install process is
    just this simple:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Download the zip archive from Featured Downloads</li>
    <li>Edit nimbits\server\war\appengine-web.xml with your appid - noting the version</li>
    <li>Run the following command using appcfg from your App Engine SDK bin directory pointing to the war directory in
        the download:
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux users:appcfg.sh update ./war</li>
        <li>Windows users:appcfg.cmd update .\war</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Log into your app engine account and set the current version to match the version in appengine-web.xml</li>
    <li>Wait for it! Give app Engine a few minutes to spin things up.
        You may see a spinning Nimbits logo or get a page error in the meantime. You should log into your Admin Console and
        check the Datastore Indexes, they should all have a status of Serving.
    </li>
    <li>Browse to: http://appid.appspot.com/cron/systemCron replacing appid with your App ID.</li>
    <ul>You can now use your Nimbits Server: http://appid.appspot.com or use Google Apps for Domains to map to
        http://nimbits.yourdomain.com
    </ul>
    <ul>Log back into your app engine console and set the version. Also take a look at the System Setting objects in the
        data store viewer. Edit thesessettings to customize your Nimbits Server.
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Detailed instructions</h3>

<p>Deploying or updating an instance of Nimbits Server simply involves downloading the latest version, extracting the
    archive, editing a configuration file and then deploying it to Google App Engine using a program that comes with the
    App Engine SDK called appcfg.</p>

<p>The server you are downloading is also running right now on https://cloud.nimbits.com. Feel free to log into this
    instance and explore the features. After setting up your own server, the Nimbits Android Phone App, and any of the
    examples on our blog can be modified to use your server.</p>

<p>Nimbits is a product released by Nimbits Inc. a Cloud Computing Consulting Service. If you need assistance
    installing or managing a Nimbits server please visit the Nimbits Website for support and contact information.
    http://www.nimbits.com</p>

<h3>Billing</h3>
<p>Google provides generous free quotas, and our experience has shown that these free quotas are enough to use Nimbits
    for a long time before being charged. High volume use of Nimbits will incur app engine charges or result in a “quota
    expired” message. To learn more about App Engine Billing please read:
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Log into App Engine with your Google account here:
    <a href="https://appengine.google.com" target="_blank">
        https://appengine.google.com</a>. </p>

<p>Click the “Create an Application” to create the application identifier that you will upload Nimbits to. Call it
    whatever you like.</p>

<p>This will be your App ID and part of the URL you'll use to access your server. For example: yourAppID.appspot.com</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">Download</A> the latest version of the JAVA App Engine SDK
    for your platform and unzip into a folder on your computer.</p>

<p>Download the Nimbits Server and extract the files to a folder.</p>

<h4>Configure Nimbits</h4>
<p>Edit the file nimbits/server/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml and replace the line below with your application ID that
    you created above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;application&gt;
    nimbits1
&lt;/application&gt;
</pre>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE the line directly under that listing the version. This is not the server version, it is the app
    engine version. After you deploy Nimbits, you'll need to log into your app engine account and select the version you
    deploy as the current version to serve.</strong></p>

<p>The rest of Nimbits' settings are kept in the data store and will be configured after it is deployed. Note the
    version number in this file too. You will need to make this the current version you are hosting.</p>

<h4>Deploy to App Engine</h4>
<p>You will now use the app engine SDK to deploy Nimbits to app engine. You can learn more about this process here:
    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/uploading.html" target="_blank">
        http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/uploading.html</a></p>

<p>Simple run at a command line: appengine-sdk-directory/bin/appcfg.sh (or appcfg.cmd if you're using windows)from your
    App Engine SDK download directory and provide the location of the war directory from your Nimbits Server
    Download.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
.\bin\appcfg.cmd update [extractdirectory]\nimbits\server\war
</pre>

<p>Google will prompt you for your email and password during the upload.</p>

<p>This command reads the appengine-web.xml you edited above and deploys it to app engine.</p>

<p>Return to https://appengine.google.com/ and select your Nimbits application ID. Under the Administration section
    select Versions. Make the app engine version number you just deployed is the current / default version.</p>

<h3>Initialize your Nimbits Server (First Time Deploying)</h3>

<p>Before you can use the server, the System Maintenance service must be ran once.
    Browse to this URL, replacing cloud.nimbits.com with your applicationID.appspot.com URL:</p>

<p><strong>http://yourappid.appspot.com/cron/systemCron</strong></p>

<h4>Add your settings to the Data Store</h4>

<p>Return to https://appengine.google.com/ and select your Nimbits application ID. Here, you can see your Nimbits'
    resource usage, logs etc.</p>

<p>Click on “Data Store Viewer” under the Data category on the left. On the Query Tab, select ServerSettings. You should
    see the default settings that were generated when you ran the system maintenance service.</p>

<p>You can click on these settings and edit their values to fit your needs.
    The admin email must be your account's email in order for email alerts being sent from the system to work.</p>

<p>You can now use your Nimbits Server! Please check out the following links to learn more about connecting systems,
    software and using its services.</p>
