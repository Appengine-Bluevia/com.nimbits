<h4 style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">Create a data point from arduino using a POST</h4>


<p>This Arduino sketch will create a new data point on your account on startup, useful for initialising a new device that's just connected to the internet.
This sample requires an Arduino ethernet shield that is connected to your LAN with internet access. The ACTION parameter is what tells nimbits what to do with the
point, other options are action=delete, and action=update to delete or apply changes to a point. Using update assumes you are also providing a point in json format using the json={} parameter.</p>
<p>
    You'll also need to provide an access key with privileges to create a data point.

</p>
 <p>
     Please also note that we hardcoded the IP address of google.com, which you can get by pinging that address. This changes frequently and google load balances. 
     For production, you'll want to include the arduino DNS library to lookup a valid IP each time.
