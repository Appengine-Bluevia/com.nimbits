<p>Using the java SDK, you can write your own code to script basic functions on your nimbits account. You can download the jar from the link below, or
if your using Debian / Ubuntu you can follow our docs to download it with apt-get.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/sdk.html')">Download the Java SDK jar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything in Nimbits is an entity. Points, folders, calculations etc start out as entities. All entities
have names, descriptions, and a parent. Your user account is the top level entity, with an id of your email address
</p>

<p>
    To get started, log into nimbits and right click on your email address. Create a new read/write key with
    the scope set to <strong>user</strong>. This key can now be used to create, delete and update entities.

</p>

 <p>Create a new Java Project and add the nimbits sdk jar to your classpath. Next, try running this example from github:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/bsautner/com.nimbits/blob/master/nimbits-util/src/com/nimbits/sample/CreateTreeSample.java">CreateTreeSample.java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
 This sample will create a folder under your account, and then create a point under that folder. You can use any entity in Nimbits as a parent of another, so points can
 be placed under other points and so on. This sample can be used to create your points from templates and your own code using java objects.
