<h5>Nimbits Tutorial: Two devices communicating with each other with intelligence integration</h5>

<p>
    Nimbits data points can be configured to communicate with you using Instant Messaging protocol XMPP - this
    is the same way Google Talk, Jabber and other IM Clients communicate. Nimbits let's you give your devices, things
    and
    software the same ability to be online and present to other things connected to the cloud. Your devices can update
    their
    status of busy or available and send and receive data between themselves.


</p>
<p>
    Nimbits also enables you to add Intelligence to your data communications by integrating into the Computational
    Knowledge engine
    <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>. You can configure a data point to take information coming in
    as party of a
    query that returns real world data, which can be saved into another data point for further processing.

</p>
<p>
    This is a fun example of how you can log information into a Nimbits Data Point, have that information interpreted
    intelligently and the result relayed to another data point.
    For programmers, we also demonstrate how two devices can use XMPP to communicate with each other.
</p>

<p>
    In this example, a refrigerator is able to identify what food is being taken out of it and eaten and it's going to
    calculate the calories and send that information to an evil
    treadmill just waiting for you to break your diet so it can pre-program an exercise routine to keep you looking
    good.

</p>

<h5>
    Creating Data Points

</h5>


<p>
    We're going to need a data point to record the food being eaten (how much in grams and what type), which will also
    be setup to calculate the calories. A second point will be the recipient of
    the calorie count which the treadmill is online and connected to.

</p>

<p>
    Now let's configure data point <b>Food</b> to save the calorie count of every recorded value (written to it's number
    value
    and note fields) and store the result in the <b>Calories</b> data point.
    In the screen shot below, you can see the input is a formula Wolfram Alpha would understand if it was entered into
    <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">wolframalpha.com</a> as text i.e. <strong>calories in 100 grams of peanut
    butter</strong>
    but instead of the number <b>100</b> and the text <b>peanut butter</b>, we're putting in food.value and food.note -
    so when
    processed the current value of those two items will go in.


</p>
<p>
    You can also see the result, which I got when I clicked the <strong>Test Intelligence</strong> button. Note the
    result isn't a number, it's the full string. The result will
    be saved in calorie's data field exactly as presented here.

<h5>Setting up alerts</h5>

<p>
    Ok, now let's configure the calories data point to send any data it receives to any machine listening to that point.
    We want to tell nimbits to make the instant message machine readable
    that is, it'll send the data out as JSON since it knows a machine will handle the text message, not a human. We can
    configure the point to send any new data out, or just when the value
    is above a threshold. At this point, you're good to go and you can use this data any way you wish - the values can
    be accessed by any system using the web services, SDK or portal server.
    The below code samples will show how simple it is using the Java SDK to write a program that sends food data and to
    have another machine listening for the target point.

<h5> M2M</h5>

<p>Here is the sample code that would send some food data, presumably from our very smart refrigerator:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        GoogleUser user = UserFactory.createGoogleUser("test@example.com", "pa$$word");
        NimbitsClient client = NimbitsClientFactory.getInstance(user, "http://nimbits1.appspot.com");
        XMPPClient xmpp = XMPPClientFactory.getInstance(client, "nimbits1");
        PointName pointName = CommonFactory.createPointName("food");
        //record 200 grams of salmon were eaten
        Value value = ValueModelFactory.createValueModel(0.0, 0.0, 200, new Date(), 0, "salmon");
        boolean connected =  xmpp.connect();

        xmpp.sendValue(pointName, value);
        System.out.println("sent");

        xmpp.disconnect();

 </pre>

<p>When the nimbits server receives this information, it processes it and triggers the process of finding out how many
    calories are
    in that food, and then recording that data into the calories data point. The following code shows how to have a
    listener
    monitor the calorie data point and take an action when it recieves a new value. In our case, the evil treadmill
    could take this even
    further, determining your current exercise needs and how much you'd have to run to burn those calories</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

        GoogleUser user = UserFactory.createGoogleUser("test@example.com", "pa$$word");
        final NimbitsClient client = NimbitsClientFactory.getInstance(user, "http://nimbits1.appspot.com");
        final XMPPClient xmpp = XMPPClientFactory.getInstance(client, "nimbits1");
        final String myPointName = "calories";
        xmpp.connect();
        xmpp.addMessageReceivedListeners(new XMPPClientImpl.MessageReceivedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onMessageReceived(Point receivedDataPoint) {
                System.out.println("Received Point: " + receivedDataPoint.getName().getValue());
                 if (receivedDataPoint.getName().getValue().equals(myPointName)) {
                        System.out.print("This is my Point! Doing stuff with it");
                        String calorieData =  receivedDataPoint.getValue().getData();
                        System.out.println(calorieData);
                 }

            }
        });
        System.out.println("Listening..");
        System.in.read(); //keep the program from exiting.
