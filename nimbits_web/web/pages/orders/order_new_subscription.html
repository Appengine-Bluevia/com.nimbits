<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px">Support Services: Order a private instance with one year of support</h4>


<p> You can run your own private instance of Nimbits Server on Google App Engine.
    Complete the procedure below and we'll professionally install a private instance of Nimbits Server on Google's Infrastructure.


</p>

<p>
    When you consume resources on Google's infrastructure, Google charges will apply.
    Please see <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/billing" target="_blank">Google App Engine Billing and Budgeting. </a>
</p>

<p>
   After your order, you will be contacted by Nimbits support where we will help you create an account on Google App Engine, obtain a unique App ID
   and adding support@nimbits.com to your instance. Once complete, we will install test and configure your new Nimbits instance on your account.
