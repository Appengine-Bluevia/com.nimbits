<h5>Authenticating to Nimbits</h5>
 <div class="row-fluid">


      <div class="span6">
          <p>Nimbits supports many authentication processes including OAUTH, OpenID, and Google Authentication. The easiest way to read and write data to and from Nimbits
              is to use an Access Key, which you can create, change and delete at will</p>

          <p>An access key allows you to grant read only access to data, or read / write access to all of your data points. To create a key, right click on the point you
              want to grant access to, or your user name at the top of the tree for global access. </p>

          <h4>Access Keys</h4>


          <p>You can have many access keys on your account that, when provided, tell nimbits what you can do. Access keys can be configured
              with global access, or limited to only being able to read from a single data point. Create an access key by logging into
              Nimbits and right clicking on your user name or a data point.  From there you can enter your access key code, which can
              be any string or any length. This makes it easy to have a short url for posting to a low security point or sharing
              semi-private keys with others which you can easily revoke. </p>

          <p>
              The Web services will also accept Google Account credentials using authentication tokens from Google or an
              android phone. We greatly simplify doing this with the nimbits SDK, which already has the code you need to use
              Google accounts to authenticate to the web services.
          </p>
          <p>
              If you are a Java or .Net developer you can simply use the Nimbits SDK on the <a href="#download"
                                                                                               onclick="getContent('pages/download.html')">Download</a>
              page.
              The SDK calls all of our web services exactly the way they are documented here, and they already have the
              authentication,
              and code you need to talk to a Nimbits Server.
