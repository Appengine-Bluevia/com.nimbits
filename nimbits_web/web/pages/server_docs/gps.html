  <P>
      Nimbits records timestamped values that contain a number value (such as a temperature), text, string data (such as xml or json) and GPS Coordinates that
      can represent where a value was recorded or changed as its position on earth changed.

  </p>

        <p>
          Nimbits can help you record a general GPS location by inferring your location
      withing several miles of your actual location.  This can save you the trouble of adding GPS hardware to your project, or wasting resources determining your location yourself.
      Any POST to the Value Service which records new data can infer your approximate GPS location at the city level if you configure your data point to do so.



      When you create a data point in Nimbits, it can be configured by right clicking on it and select edit.


  </P>

   <p>
       Each time you post to the Value Service API, your GPS coordinate can be inferred and logged with each recorded value.
