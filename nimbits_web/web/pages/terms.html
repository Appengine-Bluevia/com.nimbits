<h1>Terms of Use and Privacy.</h1>

<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>
    Your privacy: We value and respect your privacy. When you log into the public nimbits server, your email address is
    saved on our system.
    We do no share, distribute or publicise your email address in any way.
    We may send you an email, typically our newsletter, that also will request you to confirm or opt out of any future
    email communications.
</p>

<p>
    Data and content: Data uploaded to a Nimbits Server is connected to a "data point" with configurable privacy
    settings.
    Data Points configured as public can be searched, indexed and read by other users.
    Uploaded SVG diagram can also be configured with privacy settings. Please be aware that Nimbits Server is designed
    to share data
    and even public data on your own instance on Nimbits Server may be viewable. We make every effort to ensure your
    email
    address and
    other contact information is not viewable with your public points and diagrams.
</p>

<h2>Using the Public Server</h2>

<p>
    You can download a copy of Nimbits Server and deploy to a Google App Engine account without limitations.
</p>

<p>
    We host an instance of Nimbits Server for all to use on <a href="https://cloud.nimbits.com">cloud.nimbits.com</a> with
    some limitations.
    Most users will not notice these limitations, nor will you if your data recording frequencies are about one a
    minute.
    If you intend to use Nimbits to record multiple values a second - particularly values that go out of their
    compression
    setting on each change, then you should set up a server of your own for that purpose.
</p>

The Nimbits Public server may receive code changes updates that change or limit the way you can access data you've
uploaded to the server.
We may, without warning limit download / upload quotas based on server load.

    <strong> How we handle possible over-use of the public server </strong>
<ol>

    <li>When we see a very large spike in CPU / Bandwidth usage, we first become very happy to see that someone out
        there is using our product.
    </li>
    <li>Next, we analyse the traffic to see if the problem is with the server itself, potentially improving the server
        for everyones benefit.
    </li>
    <li>Then, we do our best to improve whatever resource is being used at such a high level, potentially optimizing the
        process so the hits no longer show up on our radar.
    </li>
    <li>We will then attempt to contact the owner of the data points being written to using the email address on that
        account, attempting to understand their needs and how we can help.
    </li>
    <li>We also will offer to assist the owner of the points in setting up their own app engine server instance. We
        offer free advice and hourly consulting services. We also can support your server with an ongoing service
        agreement.
    </li>
    <li>If we are unable to contact the owner of the traffic we will, with a heavy heart, blacklist the source IP
        address.
    </li>
</ol>
