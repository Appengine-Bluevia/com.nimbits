<h5>Viewing your Data Points in Excel, Google Spreadsheets and other spreadsheet programs.</h5>


<p>

    All of your Nimbits data can be accessed using the REST Web Services. Therefore any program can can download data
    over HTTP can import your data. This means that when you
    feed data into a Data Point from any source, a connected spreadsheet can show the changing values and perform their
    own calculations and reporting.
