<h2>Series Service</h2>
<p>
    <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/web_service_primer.html')">Please read the web service primer</A> to
    understand how to provide proper authentication parameters.
    For simplicity, authentication parameters are now shown here.

</p>

<p><strong>com.nimbits.server.service.SeriesService</strong></p>


<p>Returns a series of data for a given point based on a requested limit of values up to 1000 records. The result is a
    list of JSON <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a>. Please see the object definition docs for more.
</p>

<h4>GET</h4>
<ul>
    <li>point - case sensitive name of the data point</li>
    <li>count -optional defaults to 10, the number of recorded values to return from the most recent back</li>
    <li>sd - optional the start date of a series. In Unix Epoch milliseconds</li>
    <li>ed -optional the end date of a series. In Unix Epoch milliseconds</li>
    <li>seg -the segment of the series to pull . See below</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Series service will only return 1000 RecordedValue objects or less.
    So, you have to call this service several times with incremented seg paramaters to download more than 1000 records.
</p>
<p>The SDK does this by requesting segments of data for a date range until the result is zero:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
while (true) {
    params = "seg=" + seg + "&sd=" + startDate.getTime() + "&ed=" + endDate.getTime() +"&point=" + URLEncoder.encode(pointName,"UTF-8");
    result = doGet(destUrl, params);
    List<RecordedValue> r = gson.fromJson(result, listType);
    if (r.size()==0) {
    break;
    }
    else {
    retObj.addAll(r);
    }
    seg +=1000;
    }
</pre>

<h4>Sample</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">http://app.nimbits.com/service/series?point=test&count=5</pre>

<p>Returns the last 5 recorded values for the point.
    JSON data contains GPS, text, and numeric values:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">[{"id":1967016,"lat":null,"lng":null,"d":0.0,"timestamp":"2010-08-01T14:47:06 +0000","pointFK":1929017,"note":null},{"id":2115002,"lat":0.0,"lng":0.0,"d":100.0,"timestamp":"2010-08-26T00:04:32 +0000","pointFK":1929017,"note":null},{"id":2219005,"lat":0.0,"lng":0.0,"d":20.0,"timestamp":"2010-09-11T16:14:42 +0000","pointFK":1929017,"note":null},{"id":2241007,"lat":0.0,"lng":0.0,"d":25.0,"timestamp":"2010-09-11T16:16:03 +0000","pointFK":1929017,"note":null},{"id":2356001,"lat":0.0,"lng":0.0,"d":251.0,"timestamp":"2010-09-20T18:07:27 +0000","pointFK":1929017,"note":null} ]
