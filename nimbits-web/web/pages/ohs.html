    The Nimbits public cloud has been online for many years now with a free quota for using our
    REST API web services for logging time series sensor data into the cloud. We've just begun adding
    an option to pay for API Credits on your account to use our services beyond the free quota.
</p>

<p>Nimbits uses a unique method for billing and managing resources. Since Nimbits is able to store any values that change over time it actually uses itself to manage your account balance! </p>
<p>By enabling billing on your account, Nimbits will create a data point for storing your account balance, and setup subscriptions to alert you when your account balance reaches zero, increases, or hits
a daily limit you can configure. </p>

<p>
    To try out Nimbits and credit your account with 5$ of API credits. Just <a href="http://cloud.nimbits.com" target="_blank">login</a> to the public Nimbits cloud with a Google account and select "Billing and Quotas" from the Settings menu.
    Click the Coupon Button and enter <strong>OHS2012</strong> as your coupon code. Nimbits will credit your account.

</p>

 <p>
     I hope this helps you get started using the Nimbits cloud for logging your open source hardware projects!
