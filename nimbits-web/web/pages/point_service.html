<h2>Point Service</h2>
<p>
    <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/web_service_primer.html')">Please read the web service primer</A> to
    understand how to provide proper authentication parameters.
    For simplicity, authentication parameters are not shown here.

</p>
<p><strong>com.nimbits.server.service.PointService</strong></p>


<p>Based on the parameters, returns a list of Points in JSON format for a given category, including all of their
    available properties (such as
    description, the points fixed GPS location, etc) or a Single Point if the name= or point= parameter is provided.

    Note – all points have a category, but when a new point is created it is assigned a special hidden blank category
    called “Nimbits_Unsorted?” that is not show in the UI

    Listing points always required authentication. Therefore the sample here will not load unless the secret parameters
    is corrected.
</p>


<h4>GET - returns a point, or a collection of points in JSON format</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        category - optional - the name of the category the points you requested belong to
    </li>

    <li>
        point - the name of the point you are requesting.
    </li>
    <li>
        uuid - optional - the uuid of the point you are requesting. This will return any point on the system if
        it is set to public.
    </li>
    <li>
        format - the output format. The default is json.
    </li>
    <li>
        count - how many recorded value records to return as a json array in the point being returned, or in the chart
        if a report is requested.
    </li>
    <li>
        sd - optional, the start date of a series of values to include in the returned points values collection. See <a
            href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/timespan.html')">Understanding Date/Time Ranges</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        ed - optional, the end date of a series of values to include in the returned points values collection. See <a
            href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/timespan.html')">Understanding Date/Time Ranges</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        offset - optional. If you are providing a date string that is the current time local to you, you can
        provide a timezone offset, which is your timezone's different to UTC time in minutes. i.e 300 for EST (UTC -5)
        This will allow nimbits to adjust to your timezone as all dates are assumed to be UTC.
    </li>


</ul>

<h4>Sample</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
          http://app.nimbits.com/service/point?email=bsautner@gmail.com&secret=server_or_user_secret&catagory=test
 </pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
          //returns a point that is set to public, so no authentication is needed.
          http://app.nimbits.com/service/point?uuid=3123-2131-12dsfsd-421123
          //this one will include 10 values of that point's data history
          http://app.nimbits.com/service/point?uuid=3123-2131-12dsfsd-421123&count=10

 </pre>

Result - In this example, one point in a JSON list containing all of the properties of that point:
