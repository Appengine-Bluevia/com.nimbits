<h5>
    Debian / Ubuntu Users
</h5>
<p>
<p>
    Edit the <strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong> file to add the Nimbits repository to the bottom:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
deb http://deb.nimbits.net/packages/ ./
    </pre>
<p>
    at a terminal, run the following commands:
</p><p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nimbits
</pre>
<P>
    Edit the file <Strong>/opt/nimbits/server/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml</Strong> and change the app id to your
    Nimbits Instance. Note the version Number you will need to
    set to the current version on the App Engine Console. Then run the following command from the bin directory in your
    App Engine SDK:
</P>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        ./appcfg.sh update /opt/nimbits/server/war

</pre>


<P>
    Depending on your needs, you can use our hosted nimbits server right now on <a href="http://app.nimbits.com">http://app.nimbits.com</a>,
    or deploy your own to
    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. You can also build
    an entire nimbits ecosystem with clusters of virtualized servers inside your companies network that can also then
    relay data out to your choice of externally hosted
    clouds. Nimbits Server can run on a laptop, server cluster, Google App Engine or Amazon's EC2 cloud.
</P>

<p>
    Nimbits Servers can be interacted with using a <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/web_service_primer.html')">collection
    of REST Web Services</a> where you can do things like record and download data.
    <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/sdk.html')">There is also an SDK</a> for working with your Nimbits
    Environment, the SDK simplifies using the REST services and handles things like authentication for you.
    It is a Java program you can include in your development projects or run independently from the command line.
</p>
<P>
    Nimbits server is built on Cloud Computing architecture which makes it highly scalable. You can run Nimbits on a
    single virtual machine and continue to add virtual machines as your resource needs increase.
    Nimbits will scale across any number of machines, sharing memory, CPU and I/O resources seamlessly.
