<h2>Data Expiration</h2>


<P>
    It can be good practice to configure a data point to automatically delete data that is older than a certain date.
    This can be good housekeeping to clean out old, scale code. It can also provide good documentation on how long you
    keep
    your data stored. Depending on your industry, you may be required to keep data up to a certain date.
</P>
<p>
    Based on your point settings, Data can be permanently deleted when it reaches a certain age. Also, incoming data
    with a timestamp
    older than the expiration setting will be ignored by the system.
</p>

<P>
    You can use a data point to record minute by minute data for a 24 hour period, and then store its 24 hour average
    into another point.
    By setting the minute to minute point's expiration to 24 hours, you can keep a record of 24 hour averages using very
    little storage.
