<h5>Nimbits timespans</h5>

<p>
    In any situation where Nimbits is receiving a text time range - that is a start and end date, submitted as a string,
    either in the UI or as a request
    to the Web Service, Nimbits will use the same pattern to try and understand what the timespan being requested should
    be. So, if you are using the series
    web service, or the chart on the UI nimbits tries to be flexible with the date format you are entering and it will
    take a date in a normal
    month, day, year format or a Unix timestamp, or even relative dates like -1d for the previous day. <img

</p>
<p>

    All Times are stored in a nimbits database as UTC time, Nimbits never modifies a time to adjust for time zones etc.
    Locales and time zones are adjusted on the UI.
</p>
<p>
    A Timespan consists of a start and end. Start is the older date and End is the most recent date.
    Yesterday would be a start and today would be an end for example.
</p>
<p>

    All web services that take a start and end date parameter for get and post request use the
    format sd=startdate&ed=enddate for a date range.
</p>

<h5>End Date Options</h5>
<p>
    The end date can be any of the global options below, but can also be a special case: *(an asterisk) or now to have
    the current time.
    This is useful for requesting the current time on repeated requests.
</p>

<h5>Start Date Options</h5>
<p>
    The end date is interpreted first so the start date can be processed relative to the end date. Start date can be any
    of the global options below or:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>s60 : 60 seconds before the end date</li>
    <li>m5 : 5 minutes before the end date</li>
    <li>h1 : One hour before the end date</li>
    <li>d4 : 4 days before the end date</li>
    <li>An absolute time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format i.e 20110428120000 for noon on April 28th 2011</li>
    <li>Unix Epoch Time in Seconds 1304058325</li>
    <li>Unix Epoch time in Milliseconds 1304058325000</li>

</ul>
