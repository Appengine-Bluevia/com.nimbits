<h5> Building a private Nimbits Cloud on your own Hardware </h5>

<p>
    Nimbits Server, a data historian, is built from the ground up to be scalable. This means its processes can be split
    among any number of computers.
    It makes the setup / installation more complex which is why companies like Amazon and Google offer to provide this
    kind of scalability out of the box.
    Indeed, you can download and install a Nimbits Server very quickly onto Google's infrastructure and tie it into your
    domain so the fact that the servers
    aren't physically on your network is relatively transparent.
</p>
<p>
    There are reasons to build your own internally. You may have a slow internet connection, or very high data demands.
    You can also use an internal Nimbits Server
    to compress and summarise averages of your high volume data, and then relay summary values to your App Engine
    instance.
</p>

<p>Nimbits leverages an open source technology called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appscale/">AppScale
    http://code.google.com/p/appscale </a>
    to run Nimbits Server locally across any number of virtualized <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Linux
        Servers</a></p>

<p>Setup can be complicated. Please consider <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/support.html')">contacting us for a
    quote</a> on setting this environment up for you.</p>


<h5>Getting Started</h5>

<p>
    The first step is to build the AppScale Environment you need. You should be able to follow their instructions to the
    point where you can load one of their Java based sample apps before trying to deploy nimbits.
</p> <p>
    Here are the steps we follow to get going. You can build AppScale servers on any virtual environment - but our steps
    here detail building a KVM virtual servers on Linux.
<h5> Initial Steps </h5>
<UL>
    <li> Starting with an Ubuntu Linux 11.10 machine, setup a KVM virtual environment: <a
            href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM" target="_blank">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM </a></li>
    <li> Follow the instructions for creating a bridged network environment, so the VMs you setup appear to be on your
        network.
        <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking" target="_blank">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking </a>
    </li>
    <li>Read and follow the instructions on Getting Started and Deploying Appscale:
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appscale/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/appscale/</a></li>
    <UL>
        <LI>Follow the instructions for building a KVM Environment.</LI>
        <LI>Instead of setting up a controller by installing AppScale Tools on my own machine, I simply used another
            instance of the pre-built image they provide.
        </LI>
        <LI>I Highly recommend using the pre-build Ubuntu 9.10 server images they provide, download and setup the image
            per their instructions, and run one instance to be your controller, and as many
            other instances as you like to run as the clustered servers.
        </LI>
        <LI>Log into each instance, set the root password and edit /etc/network/interfaces to set a static IP for your
            network and /etc/resolv.conf to match your DNS settings.
        </LI>
        <LI>Follow their instructions to install one of the java samples, and prove that it works by browsing to
            http://controler_ip_address
        </LI>
    </UL>
</UL>
<h5> Installing Nimbits Server </h5>

<p>
    On the controller, edit this the <strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong> file to add the Nimbits repository to the
    bottom:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
deb http://deb.nimbits.net/packages/ ./
</pre>
<p>
    at a terminal, run the following commands:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install nimbits
     </pre>
<p>

    You now have the latest version of Nimbits Server and the SDK in your /opt/nimbits directory. Using the same process
    you followed to deploy the sample AppScale app.


</p>
Edit the file
<Strong>/opt/nimbits/appscale/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml</Strong> and change the app id to your Nimbits Instance.
<pre class="prettyprint">
appscale-run-instances --ips ips.yaml --file /opt/nimbits/appscale


 </pre>
<p>
    Follow the process to setup an admin email and password, which Nimbits will use for your account.
</p>

<h5>Updating</h5>
<p>If we release a new version of Nimbits Server, you can upgrade your environment by running on the controller:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
appscale-remove-app --appname nimbits #the app name is whatever you have in your /opt/nimbits/appscale/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml file
appscale-upload-app /opt/nimbits/appscale

 </pre>

<p>Please note that Appscale may change the port of the url your app uses when upgrading. Browse to your Conroller's IP
    to login to AppScale, there you can monitor and control your Nimbits Instance.</p>
