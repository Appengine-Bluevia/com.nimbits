<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>
    When a DataPoint is written to with a new value, the event of recording a value can trigger a calculation.
</p>

<p>
    The formulas basic arithmetic will be executed and the resulting value will be recorded into the target point â€“ all
    compression, alerts and other functionality will then be applied to the new value as if it was a newly recorded
    value.
</p>
<p>
    A DataPoint can be a trigger, parameter or target for a formula.
</p>
<p>
    If a point is a trigger and a new value is written to it the formula assigned to that data point will be executed.
</p>
<p>
    After the formula executes successfully, the resulting double value is stored in the target point and all Record
    Value settings are processed (Such as Alerts, Compression etc)
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    To setup a calculation you need to create at least two DataPoint channels in Nimbits. A Trigger point contains the
    formula to be executed whenever that point received a new value. A target point receives the result of the
    calculation. You can also setup up to three parameter points. They will have their current values inserted into the
    calculation at variables x, y and z. Typically, the trigger point is also the x variable, causing the current value
    of the trigger (the newly recorded value) to be inserted into a formula and recorded to the target point.
</p>

<p>
    After creating your data points, log into Nimbits (app.nimbits.com) and double click the trigger point. You do not
    have to do anything to the target point. Select the point properties from the main menu and activate the calculation
    tab:
</P>

<p>
    Here, you can select the target point and points that should be the x, y and z values in the formula if you need
    them. Again, typically the target point is used as an x variable in the formula.
</p>
<p>
    Enter a formula, ensuring the x, y and z are lower case. Click test to ensure everything is working.

<p>
    Supported symbols are: , +, -, , /, ^, %, cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, atan, sqrt, sqr, log, min, max, ceil, floor,
    abs, neg, rndr.

    x + y | add the points stored in the x and y settings together and recored the result in the target
    sqrt(x) | Take the square root of x and store in the target.
