<p>Nimbits has an arduino library you can download and include in your Arduino sketches. It uses the
    Ethernet.h and DNS/DHCP libraries to relay your data to Google's infrastructure and into your Nimbits data point channels.
    Meaning, there is no need for a serial connected pc, just an arduino ethernet shield with internet access.
    The Nimbits.h library will use DHCP to allocate an IP Address for your device
    your project will be connected to your data points in Nimbits.<p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<h5>Hardware</h5>
<p>
    All you need to get started is an Arduino Board and an Ethernet Shield. Attach the two together and plug it into your network.  </p>
        <ul>
<li><A href="http://astore.amazon.com/nimbdatahist-20/detail/B006H06TVG" target="_blank"> Arduino Uno R3</A></li>
<li><A href="http://astore.amazon.com/nimbdatahist-20/detail/B006UT97FE" target="_blank">Arduino Ethernet Shield R3</a></li>
        </ul>

<h5>Software</h5>
<p>Next, <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">download the Arduino IDE from arduino.com</a></p>

<h5>Nimbits Library</h5>

<p>In your downloaded arduino IDE directory, create a folder called Nimbits in the libraries folder. Then download
Nimbits.cpp and Nimbits.h and place them in your folder</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://raw.github.com/bsautner/com.nimbits/master/nimbits-arduino/src/Nimbits.cpp">Nimbits.cpp</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://raw.github.com/bsautner/com.nimbits/master/nimbits-arduino/src/Nimbits.h">Nimbits.h</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
    Open your Arduino IDE and create a new Sketch. Import the Nimbits Library into your project. You can then create a Nimbits client object. In the example
    below we have the device connecting to nimbits1 which is the public nimbits cloud. If you are running your own instance of nimbits, replace Nimbits1 with your
    app id. Then, provide the email address for your account and the access key. If your arduino only needs to read data you can use a read only key. Use a read/write
    key with user-wide scope to create and delete points. <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/web_service_primer.html')">Read more about access keys here</a>.

</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
        #include &lt;Nimbits.h&gt;

        Nimbits nimbits("nimbits1", "example@gmail.com","myaccesskey");

        //create a point using our write auth key with global scope
        nimbits.createPoint("HelloArduino");

        //get the current number valuer
        float value = nimbits.getValue("HelloArduino");

        //get the current time from the server
        time_t time = nimbits.getTime();
        </pre>

<ul>
    <li>float getValue(String pointName): returns the current float value of a point</li>
    <li>long getTime(): returns the current time, in seconds unix time, on the server (UTC). This can save you
        from having to import other time related libraries, since you're already using http</li>

</ul>
