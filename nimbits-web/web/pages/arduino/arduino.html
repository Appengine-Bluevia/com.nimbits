<p>Nimbits has an arduino library you can download and include in your Arduino sketches. It uses the
Ethernet.h and DNS libraries to relay your data to Google's infrastructure and into your Nimbits data channel.
Meaning, there is no need for a serial connected pc, just an arduino ethernet shield with internet access.
The Nimbits.h library will use DHCP to allocate an IP Address for your device, and provided google.com is
up and available, your project will be connected to your data points in Nimbits.<p>


<ul>
    <li>float getValue(String pointName): returns the current float value of a point</li>
    <li>long getTime(): returns the current time, in seconds unix time, on the server (UTC). This can save you
    from having to import other time related libraries, since you're already using http</li>

</ul>
