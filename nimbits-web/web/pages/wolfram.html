<h5> Nimbits integrates into the WolframAlpha computational Knowledge Engine (BETA)</h5>


<p>
    WolframAlpha is a computational knowledge engine with vast data stores of information and the ability to interpret
    complex queries and mathematical formulas.


</p>

<span class="label success">BETA</span>
<p>
    Please note that this feature is currently in BETA and subject to change and my become temporarily unavailable.
</p>
<p>
    Nimbits integrates into WolframAlpha, allowing you to configure a data points to trigger a computation whenever it
    receives a new value. The result is then stored
    in a target Point. The result is that you can add <i>intelligence</i> to your software and hardware projects, using
    Nimbits' ability to relay, share and store your data streams
    and WolframAlpha's ability to understand and compute it.
</p>

<h5>Example 1: Basic Math</h5>

<p>I have two data points called "foo" and "bar" and i'm feeding a temperature in fahrenheit into it. Whenever foo gets
    a new value,
    I want to run an equation to convert foo's value to celsius and store the result in "bar"</p>
<p>Logging into Nimbits, i can right click my data point named "foo" and select the "Intelligence" tab. Here, i enter
    the formula for
    converting fahrenheit to celsius, but for the value i put the point name.value in brackets: ([foo.value] -32) *
    (5/9)</p>

<p> Now whenever foo gets a new value recorded, the value will get converted and stored in bar. You can try your formula
    first on wolframalpha.com, or find more advanced formulas
    on <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/">http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/</a>
    For example phi([foo.value]) will get the results of this number-theoretic functions</p>

<h5>Example 2: String Data</h5>

<P>
    A Nimbits Data Point stores a history of <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a>. Value objects can contain a number value, like the celsius
    value above. A GPS coordinate, an Annotation (text),
    and a raw data value (JSON Or XML) that can be any sort of data you like. In fact the Nimbits SDK allows you to
    directly store Programming Object directly into a Point.
</P><P>
    In This example, whenever foo is written to, we're going to store the result as string data in the point, instead of
    a number. This example shows getting the current
    stock price for Google and storing it as data in another point.
</P><P>
    Note the option selected to record the result as text data and the Pod Id to pull the Quote section from the
    response we get from WolframAlpha. Pod Id tells Nimbits what portion of the response you want to store in your
    point.

    Finally, checking off that I want the result in plain text gives me:

</pre>
<P> Unchecking the "Result in plain text box" gives me the data in XML.</P>
