<h2>Compression</h2>

<p>
    Compression in Nimbits allows you to filter out noise in oncoming data. This is very useful if you are recording a
    reading that
    doesn't change much. For example, a sensor that always reads the number 42 over and over again every second. Perhaps
    sometimes the
    value changes to 42.1 or 41.9 but that's just considered noise. You only want to actually record changes in readings
    of 1 or more.
</p>

<p>
    When a new value is recorded to a Data Point, one of the first things that's checked is the compression setting.
    Compression tells Nimbits to only record values that are outside of the range of the compression setting, or if the
    incoming RecordedValue is significantly different than the previously recorded value, so it is worth putting in the
    data store.
    When you set a Data Point compresion property to a value greater than zero, the system will determine if the newly
    RecordedValue is outside of the previously RecordedValue + or - the compression value. If a value is ignored do to a
    compression setting, all other services are skipped such as alerts.

<p>
    For example, a temperature data point that had a previous value of 70, and a compression setting of 1 will ignore
    any newly recorded value that that is between 71 and 69.
    Compression is useful for filtering out noise, such as a reading that goes up and down by a small value (i.e. .01)
    and you only want to record significant changes or if the incoming value is usually the same and it is inefficient
    to continuously record the same value over and over.
    The default setting for a new DataPoint PointCompression is .1
</P>

<p>
    A RecordedValue consisted of much more than a new number value, it can also contain text, GPS data etc. Newly
    RecordedValues? with a compression setting of 0 or higher with identical values as the previously recorded value
    will be ignored.
    You can turn compression off on a DataPoint by setting PointCompression to -1.
