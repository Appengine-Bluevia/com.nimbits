<h4>Email Service</h4>


<p>
    Nimbits can send you email alerts to warn you that a data point's value has exceeded a minimum or maximum number
    value,
    or if a point has not received a new value in a set number of minutes - triggering an Idle alert.
</p>

<p>
    You can also email Nimbits Servers and load data into a point using the text of an email. Nimbits will authenticate
    the email using the FROM address of the incoming email and record the data in the body of the message into the data
    points specified.
</p>

<p>
    Since your Nimbits account is tied to your email address, the data is handled based on the email address the system
    receives the email from.
    Besides being able to bulk load historical data, you can also use this method to feed data into Nimbits from Linux
    shell scripts, powershell or any other system that can send an email.
</p>

<p>
    To make use of this feature, just send an email to: <strong>data@nimbits1.appspotmail.com</strong>
</p>

<p>
    If you're running your own Nimbits Server instance on appspot, just replace Nimbits1 with your app id.
</p>

<p>
    You do not have to include a subject. In the message body add the point name (case sensitive) and a value separated
    by commas and the different points separated by semi-colons like this:
</p>

<pre>Point1,3.14;Point2,5.6</pre>

<p>Values are recorded with the current time (UTC) when the value is processed.
    If you want to specify a time stamp you can do so by including the time you want in UNIX Epoch time format in
    milliseconds.
    You can do a bulk load of point data to a single point by providing values like this:</p>

<pre>Point1,45.4,1278448474000;Point1,89.3;127844000000;Point1,44.324,12784480000</pre>


<p>Please note the time is in milliseconds, not seconds since the unix epoch.</p>
