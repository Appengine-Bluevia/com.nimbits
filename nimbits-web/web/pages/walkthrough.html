<h5>Getting started with Nimbits</h5>


<p>
    Nimbits is a software platform for sharing, storing, relaying and processing historical data in a highly scalable cloud computing based architecture.
    Everything that happens inside of nimbits revolves around a Data Point. A Data Point represents a <em>thing</em> be it a thermometer, your dog's weight,
    or anything else. The structure below summarizes a Data Point, and how when you create one you can set its properties which controls how it behaves when
    data is written to it.

        <h5>Creating a Data Point</h5>
        <p id="point">To get started, log into <a href="http://app.nimbits.com"> app.nimbits.com </a>which is the public nimbits cloud. You can then use the create point button to make a point
        with only the name. After your point is created, the defaults are to have its data expire after 90 days, to use .1 for the compression, and to make
        the point public, so others can read its data and its it's description will be searchable from nimbits.com</p>

        <h5>Recording Data</h5>
        <p id="value">After you create a data point, you can being to record data into it. This is where you can use the many web services,
            SDK, code samples and apps for doing this. A Data Point, above, records thousands of Value objects like the one to the left. That data
            can then be read in a chart, or used to relay XML or JSON data between two software systems. So, a data point represents a <em>thing</em>
            and contains a long history of timestamped value objects, each with their optional data, text and numbers</p>

        <p id="services"> After you configure your data point, the backend server can use the event of recording a new value to trigger a service. Those
            services will generate email alerts or instant messages, relay data to listening devices, post to facebook ans so on.   <img src="./images/facebook.png" align="right"></p>
