<h4>Twitter Services</h4>

<p>Nimbits can relay new point values and alerts to twitter. Just like the other alert settings, you can configure a
    data point to use twitter. Just log onto Nimbits and click the authorise facebook button. The system will take you
    to
    the Twitter Nimbits App for authorisation. That's it, Nimbits can now post your point data to your twitter feed</p>
