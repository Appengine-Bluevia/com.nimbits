    <a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/web_service_primer.html')">Please read the web service primer</A> to
    understand how to provide proper authentication parameters.
    For simplicity, authentication parameters are not shown here.

</p>


<p>A highly efficient service for loading many values at once in a single post.
    Accepts up to 100 new values for points in one post. Simply provide a parameter with an incrementing number for each
    new value to record. For example, p1=FirstPoint&v1=1.23&p2=SecondPoint&v2=3.14.
</p>

   <p>
       This will save the value 1.23 into a point called FirstPoint, and 3.14 into SecondPoint. Both will get the current time
       as a timestamp.

   </p>

    <p>
        You can include a timestamp and nimbits will record your value with the stamp you provide. You can also give the same
        point with many timestamped values, or mix and match. i.e  p1=FirstPoint&v1=1.23&t1=1297655407000&p2=FirstPoint=3.14&t2=1297655408000


    </p>
        <p>
            This will record the two values into FirstPoint with different timestamps.

        </p>

        <p><span class="label-success">Heads up!</span>
            There is a new option for loading the batch service using JSON data containing an array of
            <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>p(x) - the name of the point</li>

    <li>v(x)  - the new value belonging to p1.</li>

    <li>t(x)  - optional - the timestamp as a long, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" target="_blank">

        unix epoch time</a> <strong>in milliseconds</strong>. Can also be in scientific notation i.e 1.3190148e+12</li>
    <li>lt(x)  - optional - the latitude of the reading</li>
    <li>ln(x)  - optional - the longitude of the reading</li>
    <li>dx(x)  - optional - raw string data to be recorded (i.e json or xml) </li>
    <li>j(x) - optional - an array of JSON formatted <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects.</a>
        <br>
        <span class="label-success">Please Note:</span> using this option will override any other parameters set from the list above. This also
        is a highly efficient way to slam new data into a point and therefore, compression filters, alerts and other point settings are not
        processed when data is fed in. The system assumes you have already formatted / filtered your incoming data the way you want it. So, the new
        data goes directly into the store. Read the <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a> document for
        samples of a value json structure

    </li>
</ul>
