<h5>Javascript and AJAX with Nimbits</h5>


<p>You can develop your own web sites and dynamic content with a Nimbits Server as your back end.
    The basic concept is that all of the Web Services available that expose nimbits data can return data in JSON format.
    This means it's very easy to get and work with data from a Nimbits Service.</p>

<p>We whipped up a limited javascript library that you can use to get started. The code simply takes a point name, and a count for the number of values
you'd like to pull down, as well as the URL of the server where the point you're interested in resides.
    In this example, I'm using the public nimbits cloud on: http://nimbits.appspot.com a.k.a http://app.nimbits.com</p>

<p>
   Every Nimbits data point has a unique identifier that makes it identifiable across all of time and space. The UUID is unique to that point even across any number
    of Nimbits Servers.

</p>

<h5>A quick download</h5>

<p>This example shows how to download a single data point</p>

<p>Just add a link to the current nimbits javascript library in the head section of your html page. In this case i'm using version 3.3 from the
public cloud. If you are running your own instance of Nimbits, you can use that one.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
 &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://app.nimbits.com/assets/js/nimbits-3.3.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 </pre>
 <p>
    This little example shows querying nimbits using the UUID of a data point. You can get the UUID of a point by opening its properties on a Nimbits Server.
    or using the data point Search Engine on nimbits.com.  This example shows making the javascript call to download the point, and providing a callback function.
    The call back then displays the current value and name of the point in a popup.
 </p>

 <pre class="prettyprint">
     &lt;body&gt;

     &lt;a href="#" onclick="getPoint(callback, 'http://app.nimbits.com', '96c55c29-d60f-42a1-82a9-98d8a76960bd', 10)"&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;

     &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"&gt;
         function callback(point) {

             alert(point.name + " current value:" + point.value.d);
         }

     &lt;/script&gt;


     &lt;/body&gt;
