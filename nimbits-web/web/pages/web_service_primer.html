<h4>Web Services</h4>

<p>
    You can push and pull data from a Nimbits Server,
    be it your own instance or the public server using a collection of Web Services.
    The web services allows you to create data points, categories, and record data to your points
    in many different ways. In general, all web service respond to simple <strong>POST</strong>
    and <strong>GET</strong> actions and respond with
    text, or JSON data.
</p>
<p>
    You can program against the web services, or use them directly by putting the url to a service
    in a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Docs.

</p>
<p>
    Each web service call must be properly authenticated. This can be done simply by providing your
    email address and Nimbits client key. (you can get a key by logging into Nimbits and clicking the secret key button)
</p>

<p>Start any web request with these parameters in the post or get command:</P>
<pre class="prettyprint">
           http://appid.appspot.com/service/theservice?email=test@example.com&secret=yoursecretkey&...
         </pre>

<p>
    The Web services will also accept Google Account credentials using authentication tokens from Google or an
    android phone. We greatly simplify doing this with the nimbits SDK, which already has the code you need to use
    Google accounts to authenticate to the web services.
</p>

<p>
    If you are a Java or .Net developer you can simply use the Nimbits SDK on the <a href="#download"
                                                                                     onclick="getContent('pages/download.html')">Download</a>
    page.
    The SDK calls all of our web services exactly the way they are documented here, and they already have the
    authentication,
    and code you need to talk to a Nimbits Server.
