                     You can push and pull data from a Nimbits Server,
                     be it your own instance or the public server using a collection of Web Services.
                     The web services allows you to create data points, categories, and record data to your points
                     in many different ways. In general, all web service respond to simple <strong>POST</strong>
                     and <strong>GET</strong> actions and respond with
                     text, or JSON data.
                 </p>
<p>
    You can program against the web services, or use them directly by putting the url to a service
    in a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Docs.

</p>
<p>
    Each web service call must be properly authenticated. This can be done simply by providing your
    email address and Nimbits client key.
</p>


<p>Start any web request with these parameters in the post or get command:</P>
<pre class="prettyprint">
           http://appid.appspot.com/service/theservice?email=test@example.com&key=youraccesskey&...
         </pre>
<p><span class="label label-warning">@Deprected Warning: use key instead of the old 'secret' param. 'secret= has been deprecated</span>
</p>

<h4>Access Keys</h4>


                    <p>You can have many access keys on your account that, when provided, tell nimbits what you can do. Access keys can be configured
                        with global access, or limited to only being able to read from a single data point. Create an access key by logging into
                        Nimbits and right clicking on your user name or a data point.  From there you can enter your access key code, which can
                        be any string or any length. This makes it easy to have a short url for posting to a low security point or sharing
                        semi-private keys with others which you can easily revoke. </p>

                 <p>
                     The Web services will also accept Google Account credentials using authentication tokens from Google or an
                     android phone. We greatly simplify doing this with the nimbits SDK, which already has the code you need to use
                     Google accounts to authenticate to the web services.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     If you are a Java or .Net developer you can simply use the Nimbits SDK on the <a href="#download"
                                                                                                      onclick="getContent('pages/download.html')">Download</a>
                     page.
                     The SDK calls all of our web services exactly the way they are documented here, and they already have the
                     authentication,
                     and code you need to talk to a Nimbits Server.
