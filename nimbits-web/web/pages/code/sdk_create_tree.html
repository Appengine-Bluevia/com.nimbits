<p>Using the java SDK, you can write your own code to script basic functions on your nimbits account.</p>
<uL>
<li><a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/sdk.html')">Download the Java SDK jar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything in Nimbits is an entity. Points, folders, calculations etc start out as entities. All entities
have names, descriptions, and a parent. Your user account is the top level entity, with an id of your email address
</p>

<p>
    To get started, log into nimbits and right click on your email address. Create a new read/write key with
    the scope set to <strong>user</strong>. This key can now be used to create, delete and update entities.

</p>

 <p>Create a new Java Project and add the nimbits sdk jar to your classpath. Next, try running this example from github:</p>

    <li><a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/sdk.html')">Download the Java SDK jar</a></li>
