<h2>The Data feed channel</h2>


<p>
    Every nimbits users has a data feed channel, which is simply a data point in which status, error, system, and broadcast messages are logged. Since this data point has the same filter
    settings as any other point, repeated messages are filtered, so you won't see the same error over and over for example. If you connect to other users using the connection feature, you
    can view their feed.


</p>
<p>
     Since your feed is a point, it can be connected to Nimbits services, customised to relay data to twitter or facebook, and you can access it using the API services. The feed channel is located
    on the right side of the server portal where you can view your feed, the feeds belonging to your connections, and filter the view to show status updates, errors and so on.
