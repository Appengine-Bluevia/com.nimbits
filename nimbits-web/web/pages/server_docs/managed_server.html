<p>If you have a support agreement with Nimbits Inc. and you receive a notice that we have deployed a new version
    of Nimbits Server to your instance, there are a few steps you need to take. </p>

<p>To avoid upgrading your instance with a change that may be disruptive, we always deploy new code with a new version
    number. You have complete control over when that new version goes live and you can test your applications against this
    never version to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

<p>You also have the ability to use traffic splitting so only a small segment of network traffic will use the new code.
    Learn more about <a href ="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/trafficsplitting">Traffic Splitting</a></p>

<p>To activate a new version, log into the <a href="https://appengine.google.com">App Engine Console</a>, select Versions from the side bar, and decided what version to
    make the default. If you have any problems, you can roll back to previous versions safely.</p>
