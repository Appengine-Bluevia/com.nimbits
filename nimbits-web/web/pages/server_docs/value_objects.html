<p>
    Think of a data point in nimbits as a bucket, and we fill it with <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a>. As Values go into the bucket, alerts, stats and other
    events are triggered. Further, there are rules on what can go into the bucket based on the Point's settings like filters that say only values
    within a certain range can go in.


</p>

 <p>
     A Value Object can consists of the following:




 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Timestamp: saved in UTC format on the cloud
            </li>
            <li>
                Double Value: such as 1.23
            </li>
            <li>
                GPS Coordinates
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: A string note
            </li>
            <li>
                Data: String data, such as xml or JSON
            </li>
            <li>
                State: the alert state, such as high, low or idle.
            </li>

        </ul>

 <p>
     To save space in storage and on the wire, we abbreviate the names of the above fields.


 </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      ts: Timestamp
    </li>
    <li>
      d: The double value
    </li>
    <li>
       lt, ln: Latitude and Longitude
    </li>
    <li>
       n: Note
    </li>
    <li>
      dx: Data
    </li>
    <li>
      st: State
    </li>

</ul>

 <p>
     When Sending and receiving raw Value Object, they will come to you in JSON format.
