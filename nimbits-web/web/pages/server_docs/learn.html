<p>OK! Let's get started. Here is Step 1 for getting connected to the cloud.</p>

<p>
  Nimbits is a big system, with a lot of moving parts. There is a lot of power inside its cloud. We recomend getting started the
    same way you'd eat an elephant: One bite at a time.


</p>

<h5>Test drive the public cloud</h5>
<p>
  Here is the link to the administrative console for Nimbits server: <a href="http://app2.nimbits.com">http://app2.nimbits.com</a>
</p>
 <p>It's worth mentioning that we target Google Chrome as the supported browser for Nimbits, but it also works on most standards
 based browsers such as FireFox. If you're using Internet Explorer, you may be prompted to install <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome Frame</a>
 which is an add-on that will make Nimbits run faster in IE.</p>
<p>
  The admin console lets you manage your account, upload and download data manually and create "things".  When you log in, you'll
  be prompted to log in with a Google Account, since that's what we use for this instance's security. This can be a gmail account,
  but it can also be any email, even your company's email i.e boss@bigcompany.com. Follow the steps for registering your email address
  with Google or <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount">
  sign up for a google account</a>, and you'll be good to go.
</p>

<h5>Create a Data Point</h5>

<p>A Point represents a thing. You're child's weight, the core temperature of a nuclear power plant, the temperature of an aquarium,
nitrogen content on a sensor on your Mars rover. Whatever you have to record. A point is a bucket for recording timestamped
<a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a> which contain gps, numbers, xml, or json
data.</p>

<img src="/images/screens/file_menu.png" alt="cloud"/>
<p>
<span class="label label-success">Everything in Nimbits can be automated using code and our REST API</span>
<h5>Entities and Organization</h5>
</p>

<p>
   When you log into Nimbits you'll see your account name, which is the top of a tree where you can organise your stuff. When you
    add a data point, it will appear under your account name. </p>
<p>As you add more stuff, you can drag and drop them around your tree to organize
    them how you like. You can have many child points under a parent one, or folders, files and so on.</p>




<h5>Basic Point Settings</h5>
<img src="/images/screens/general_properties.png" style="float: right;" alt="cloud"/>
<p>
    Right click on your new Point and select Edit. Here you can set your point's settings.

</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#" onclick="getContent('pages/server_docs/filters.html')"><span class="label">Compression Filters:</span></a>
    Filters give you a way to tell Nimbits to reject data that should not be recorded. Noisy, repetitive data can be screened out. </li>
    <li><span class="label">Expire:</span> Tell Nimbits to automatically delete data that is older than you want to keep</li>
    <li><span class="label">Unit of Measure:</span> Whatever label you want to apply, such a Watts for an electrical reading.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Who can view:</span> determines if anyone can read your data point and find it in the search engine, people who connected account with,
    or only you.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Descriptions:</span> It's important to set a description if you want your point to be easier to find in the search engine.</li>

</ul>


<h5>Alerts</h5>

    <p>Alerts tell Nimbits that the state of a points will go into a <span class="label label-important">High</span>
        or <span class="label label-info">Low</span> Alert State when a value comes in above or below a setting.
    Also, a point can go into a <span class="label label-warning">Idle</span> alert state if a point does not receive a new value for a set amount of time.</p>

<span class="label label-success">You can subscribe to points belonging to other users, getting notified of their alerts.</span>

<h5>Subscriptions and Notifications</h5>

   <p>You can subscribe to a point and ask Nimbits to Notify you when events occur. You can configure many subscriptions, getting alerted
       in different ways based on the settings. Right click on your new Data Point and select <span class="label label-success">Subscribe</span>.
   </p>
<img src="/images/screens/subscribe.png"  alt="cloud"/>

 <p>
     When you create a subscription, it will appear as a new icon under your data point in the tree. You can organize your subscriptions
     any way you like. Their location in the tree has nothing to do with their settings or what point you're subscribing to. I like to keep all
     of my subscriptions in a folder.  In the image below, you can see how I have two subscriptions to my Aquariums temperature probe, one to alert
     me if the temp goes too high, another to let me know if a value hasn't been recorded in a while, so maybe my probe is off.

 </p>
<img src="/images/screens/subscriptions.png"  style="float: right;"  alt="cloud"/>
<p>A point can be in one of four states</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="label">Normal</span> All is well.</li>
    <li><span class="label">High:</span> The last recorded number value was higher or equal to the high alert setting.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Low:</span> The last recorded number value was lower or equal to the high alert setting.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Idle:</span> The point has not received a new value in a set number of time, based on the idle
        setting.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>When a point goes into an Alert State, it will attempt to notify you in ways set in the point's properties.
    <BR/>
    The following alert methods are available</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="label">Email</span></li>
    <li><span class="label">Instant Message XMPP</span></li>
    <li><span class="label">Facebook</span></li>
    <li><span class="label">Twitter</span></li>
    <li><span class="label">Your Data Feed Point</span></li>
    <li>When using the portal or android app, point icons change color based on the alert state.</li>
</ul>

<span class="label label-success">You can choose to have the content of an alert sent in JSON format, so other programs can pick it up.</span>

        <p>
            Now that you have a point created, you can being recording data. Think of a point as a bucket filled with timestamped <a href="#" onclick="getContent('/pages/server_docs/value_objects.html')">Value Objects</a>.
            You can store much more than a series of numbers in a point. Each recorded value can contain:    </p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="label">A Number:</span> e.g. a temperature, or any decimal value.</li>
    <li><span class="label">A Timestamp:</span> Stored in UTC time</li>
    <li><span class="label">GPS Coords</span></li>
    <li><span class="label">Text String:</span> Notes, used in annotations etc.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Data:</span> Any string data, such as XML or JSON</li>

</ul>
