<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis" target="_blank">Understanding Hysteresis</a></p>

<p>
    Filters in Nimbits allows you to filter out noise in incoming data. This is very useful if you are recording a
    reading that
    doesn't change much, or fluctuates between small changes but you are only interested in significant changes.
    For example, a sensor that always reads the number 42.0 over and over again every second. Perhaps
    sometimes the
    value changes to 42.1 or 41.9 but that's just considered noise. You only want to actually record changes in readings
    of 1 or more. You would configure your data point to have a Fixed Hysteresis filter of 1.0.
</p>

<p>
    When a new value is recorded to a Data Point, one of the first things that are checked is the filter setting.
    Filters tell Nimbits to only record values that are outside of the range of the filter setting, or if the
    incoming RecordedValue is significantly different than the previously recorded value, so it is worth putting in the
    data store.
    default setting for a new DataPoint PointFilter is .1
</P>
<h4> Types of Filters</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed Hysteresis.</b> When a new value is recorded, the previously recorded value is accessed and the new value is only recorded if it is greater or less than the previous value +/-
    the filter setting.</li>
    <li><b>Percentage Hysteresis.</b> When a new value is recorded, the previously recorded value is accessed and the new value is only recorded if it is greater or less than the previous value +/-
        the filter setting as a percentage. i.e if the filter setting is set to 5 and the previous value was 100 - new values of 95 - 105 would be ignored, but outside that range would be recorded since 5% of 100 = 5</li>
    <li><b>Floor.</b> No values below the floor setting will be recorded.</li>
    <li><b>Ceiling.</b> No value above the ceiling setting will be recorded.</li>

</ul>
