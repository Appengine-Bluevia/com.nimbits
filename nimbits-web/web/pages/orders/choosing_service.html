    Nimbits is the only platform for the Internet of Things that allows you to use a public cloud that we host, your own instance on a cloud provider like App Engine or
    Amazon EC2, or on your own infrastructure.  We also provide support for all of these options. This guide can help you decide which type of service is right for you.

        Easiest! The Public Cloud

    </h5>



<p>

    We host this instance and manage the monitoring and upgrades. We handle the cost of ownership and provide a free quota for users only requiring a small amount
    of API calls a day. Uploading and downloading data is capped by a free quota, with the option of adding API credits to your account. You don't need to do anything to get
    start, just <a href="#store" onclick="getContent('pages/login.html')">Login</a>.

<h5>
    Private Cloud

</h5>

<p> You create an instance on AppSpot.com and download and install nimbits yourself or order one of our support packages.</p>

    <Strong>Reasons to do this:</Strong>
    <ul>
        <li>You can control when and how your Nimbits instance is upgraded and patched.</li>
        <li>You can have more granular control
    over your usage with access to the App Engine admin console</li>
        <li>Privacy, your completely own your data without anyone in between, even us.

     </ul>

    <h5>
        Internal Instance using AppScale

    </h5>

    <p> You can run a Nimbits Instance on your own infrastructure using a product called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appscale/">AppScale</a>. The setup is somewhat complex, requiring KVM based virtual machines
    running linux. Nimbits can then be scaled across many servers internally.</p>

    <Strong>Reasons to do this:</Strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete ownership of the hardware, security and data </li>
        <li>Using your existing infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>
         A private instance using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appscale/">AppScale</a> is a complicated setup - please contact us to discuss support options.
