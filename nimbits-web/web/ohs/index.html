     <h4>Thanks for attending the Open Source Hardware Summit with us!</h4>

<p>
    The Nimbits public cloud has been online for many years now with a free quota for using our
    REST API web services for logging time series sensor data into the cloud. We've just begun adding
    an option to pay for API Credits on your account to use our services beyond the Free Quota.
